Bamazon Customer is a retail app that allows the user to select from a list of 10 items by the Item_Id.  Once the item_id is selected the user enters the amount of units they would like to purchase.  The app then displays the total dollar amount of the sale and reduces the number of units from the inventory.  If the amount of units is less than the users request, an "Insufficient Quantity!" message is displayed.
